Some cases might not be available.\n\nTo submit your solution, click on the submit link and send your file.\nIn this scenario the solution is given in the end of the page.\n\nIn order to test your solution run it using the test cases.\nTo run it in your machine:\nDownload all the files to the same directory.\nExecute the R script, enter one input file, check if it matches the output in the solution.\n\nThe judge script will run using:\n$ cat <input_file> | Rscript sample_submission.R > <output_file>\n$ diff <output_file> <response_file>\n\n\n\n\nIn this problem, create a script in R that will get in its input a filename. Open the dataset with the name given, then cat the filename in a line, then cat the mean value of the 'value' column in another line. Check the solution if needed.",
